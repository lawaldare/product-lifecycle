# Product Lifecycle  

## Requirements
Fellows are required to have completed the following Outcomes: 1 - 8

## Problem Description
A product lifecycle where goods go from one stage to the other in real time. E.g A product goes from the Producer to the Retailer and to the Consumer and the Recycler takes the waste from the Consumer and recycle for the Producer to use in the next production line in real time. The retailer waits for the producer to produce the goods when they ran out of stock. The consumer waits for the retailer to buy from the producer and the Recycler waits on the Consumer to recycle. Think of it as a Mineral or Bear bottling product. When any of the above-listed stages run out of resources to execute, It waits for the supplier before it can continue.
All actions are listed printed to the console and log into a file in real time. A file containing initial actions for each stage will be provided. Your output file should be added to git before final submission.

## How will I complete this project?
Use ES6 consistently throughout the project 
You can use Node JS for this task only as an application server, Use design patterns as much as possible. Avoid using inbuilt Node features and do not require or import any Node Lib accept fs for writing and reading from files.
Organise the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests
Write tests to cover all the methods to be written, before development begins (TDD) 
Test acceptance is 97% coverage.
From the Product-Input file, The producer should produce all items without a stage listed beside.
All impunity should be removed and not processed. E.g // and random spaces should not be processed too.
Performance of your solution is super important and should never hang or crash.
The output file should state where the product is coming from and where itâ€™s going without impunity 
The input file should never be touched.
All products are to be produced by the same producer.
