# Project Title

A product lifecycle where goods go from one stage to the other in real time. E.g A product goes from the Producer to the Retailer and to the Consumer and the Recycler takes the waste from the Consumer and recycle for the Producer to use in the next production line in real time. The retailer waits for the producer to produce the goods when they ran out of stock. The consumer waits for the retailer to buy from the producer and the Recycler waits on the Consumer to recycle. Think of it as a Mineral or Bear bottling product. When any of the above-listed stages run out of resources to execute, It waits for the supplier before it can continue. All actions are listed printed to the console and log into a file in real time. A file containing initial actions for each stage will be provided. Your output file should be added to git before final submission.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* An editor

* Nodejs to run the project on your machine

* Jest for the testing

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

* clone the repo

* Install your editor e.g. Vscode

* Install Nodejs on your system

* Intialize npm 
```
npm init
```
Install jest for the testing
```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
